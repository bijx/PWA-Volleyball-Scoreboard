# Volleyball Scoreboard Progressive Web App
A simple sports scoreboard that you can download and use offline as a Progressive Web App (PWA) on mobile devices. No ads (crazy that's even a selling point), originally made for volleyball, but could be used for any sport (up to a max score of 99).

Tap the top of the box to increase score, tap the bottom to decrease, tap the round button to reset the score!
